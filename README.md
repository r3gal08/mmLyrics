**Lyric Discovery and Presentation Platform**  

This software leverages cloud-based services like ACRCloud (for audio recognition) and MusixMatch (for lyric retrieval) to create a platform for detecting and displaying synced lyrics of nearby playing music.  

I initially began working on the program for myself, as often when I am listening to music on my record player I tend to follow along with the lyrics on a platform such as Genius (particularly when I'm listening to albums such as MF DOOM's 
"mm..Food").

Development on this project is currently on hold while I focus on other side projects and studies.
